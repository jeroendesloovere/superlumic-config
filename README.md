# superlumic-config

Based on the excellent work by [Roderik Van Der Veer](https://github.com/superlumic/superlumic) and slightly modified to fit our needs at Wijs

## Structure

First of all, you'll need a config file per user in /users. Use
firstnamelastname.yml as the filename. You'll use this file to call the
superlumic script.

In the user file you need to specify:

* the roles applicable. As of now there is a general role and a developer
specific role
* Any personal apps and/or preferences. People can edit their own file via pull
requests where needed.
